Active Authentication is a free and open source personal access control system.

== Purpose ==

The purpose of the Active Authentication system is to protect your system from access by 
unauthorized individuals.  The system works by comparing the typing behavior of the 
individual currently using the computer to the stored profile of the computer's owner (or 
profiles of other authorized users).  When suspicious typing behavior is detected further 
access to the computer is blocked until a one time password, sent to the owner's 
registered mobile phone and email account, is entered.  One time passwords are also 
required to access the system's administrative functions.

== Getting started ==

Install Active Authentication by either using the Installer.msi or Installer.exe files.
If you downloaded the Installer package or the bin package these files will be directly
in the compressed folder you downloaded. If you downloaded the src package these files
will be in the Installer/Install directory. Upon initial installation the program will 
enter a 'training' mode in which it automatically constructs profiles that summarize
the manner in which the user types.  During training, the user will be able to continue 
using his or her computer in the usual manner.  Once installed and trained the program is 
designed to run continuously and should not need any further input from the user to 
start it.

== System requirements ==

Windows 7 or later, 32-bit or 64-bit.

== Roles ==

Owner:  The user Active Authentication recognizes as the computer's owner, and primary 
	administrator.  By default the owner is the user who first installed Active 
	Authentication.  However, the owner role can be reassigned by the current owner 
	to any user who holds administrator privileges.

User:	All individuals registered with Active Authenticaton who are not the owner. 

== Administrative Features ==

To access the Active Authentication administrative features simply right click the "A" 
icon in your icon tray at the bottom right of the screen.  Note that in order to invoke 
an administrative feature you will be required to authenticate via a one time password 
sent to both your email address and phone number. 

Administrative Features available to all users include:

	Pause:  Allows a user to pause the authentication process for whatever reason. 
		This feature may be used when the user realizes he or she may soon lose 
		access to the internet, such as immediately prior to boarding a plane.  
		Internet access is required for Active Authentication to send one time 
		passwords. Active Authentication can be paused for up to 24 hours, and 
		un-paused at any time. 

	Change Phone Number And Email Address:  Allows a user to change his or her contact
		information. This feature requires the user to verify his or her updated 
		contact information before the update takes effect.

	Clear Profiles:  Allows a user to clear the profiles generated by the system.
		Once cleared, new profiles will be generated by the system, through the 
		same training cycle that took place when the system was first installed. 
		Clearing profiles should only be undertaken when owners and/or valid users
		are frequently misidentified as imposters.  

Administrative Features available only to the Owner include:

	Change Machine Owner:  Allows the Owner to reassign the Owner role to another 
		user. The user being assigned the Owner role must be an administrator. 
		There can only be one Owner. 

	Invalidate Users:  Allows the Owner to disable other users. If for any reason the 
		Owner decides to revoke access to a registered user, then the Owner can 
		use this feature to do so.  This (former) user will now be identified as
		an imposter and locked out of the system if they attempt to use it. 

== Re-authentication ==

There are various reasons a user may be required to re-authenticate.  The reason the 
system requests reauthentication will be displayed in the re-authentication dialog and 
in the messages sent to the user. Messages are sent to the user's phone in the form of
a text message and to the user's email address. These messages will contain a one time 
password used to re-authenticate the user. Simply enter the password into the appropriate
field on the lock screen and press enter.

== Icon Color ==

The "A" icon in the icon tray at the bottom right of your screen will change color based 
on your typing data.
If the icon is green Active Authentication has full faith that you are the authorized user. 
If the icon is yellow Active Authentication is less sure of the identity of the user.
If the icon is red Active Authentication believes an imposter may be attempting to access
your system and locks the computer requiring a one time password be entered.

== Uninstallation ==

Active Authentication can be uninstalled through the installer file or through the control
panel like any other application.  The only special circumstances involved with Active 
Authentication is that in order to complete an uninstallation the Owner must provide a 
one time password. Active Authentication will only send the code to the Owner.
